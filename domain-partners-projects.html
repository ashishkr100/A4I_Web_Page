        For 2025–2026, A4I is partnering with three leading organizations in education and healthcare to scale impactful
        solutions across underserved communities. Below is an overview of our collaborative framework, followed by
        detailed sections on each partner and their flagship project.

      <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">
	Three flagship projects have been prioritized for immediate scaling through the A4I collaborative framework: Shiksha Copilot, its extension Shiksha SEEDS, and ASHA Saheli for last-mile healthcare delivery. These initiatives are strategically aligned with the Government of India’s AI mandate and the IndiaAI Mission, positioning them as strong candidates to evolve into Digital Public Goods (DPGs) for adoption by central and state governments.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">
Each solution is designed to scale through trusted human intermediaries, such as teachers and health workers, who act as amplifiers of generative AI tools, extending their benefits far beyond direct users. For instance, 10,000 teachers using Shiksha Copilot could positively affect nearly one million students. With support from A4I and the open sourcing of these solutions, their reach is expected to expand from their current bases in Karnataka, Telangana, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan to other Indian states and countries across the Global South and Africa.

        <strong>About the Organization:</strong><br>
        Khushi Baby is a digital‐health non‐profit headquartered in Udaipur, Rajasthan. Their Community Health Integrated
        Platform (CHIP) centers on the “Khushi Necklace,” a wearable RFID tag that stores immunization and maternal health
        records for mothers and infants. The data syncs via mobile applications to give frontline health workers
        up-to-date patient information, improving immunization rates and reducing missed appointments. Since inception,
        Khushi Baby has empowered over 75,000 health workers and reached more than 48 million beneficiaries across rural
        India.

        ASHA Saheli is a last-mile healthcare delivery platform co-developed with A4I. Building on Khushi Baby’s wearable
        technology, ASHA Saheli equips Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) with a mobile app to track maternal and
        child health metrics, schedule vaccinations, and identify high-risk cases. Leveraging AI-driven alerts and GIS
        mapping, ASHA Saheli ensures timely interventions for pregnant women and newborns in underserved villages. The
        platform integrates with state health databases to maintain continuity of care and facilitate data-driven decision
        making at scale.

        <strong>About the Organization:</strong><br>
        Established in 2002 and based in Bangalore, Sikshana Foundation works to improve learning outcomes in government
        primary schools across Karnataka. They partner with state education departments, local communities, and volunteers
        to deliver teacher training, foundational literacy and numeracy programs, and ICT integration. Their data-driven
        approach has consistently led to measurable gains in student performance, with many districts adopting Sikshana’s
        model as their standard best practice.

        Shiksha Copilot is an AI-powered teaching assistant that provides real-time lesson planning, automated remedial
        content, and individualized feedback to teachers. Integrated into the existing classroom ecosystem, it uses
        natural language processing to analyze student responses and suggest differentiated activities. This tool empowers
        educators to address learning gaps proactively and foster a supportive learning environment in resource-
        constrained settings.

        <strong>About the Organization:</strong><br>
        Vision Empower Trust is a Karnataka-based non-profit incubated at IIIT Bangalore. Their mission is to empower
        children with visual impairment through inclusive STEM education. By designing accessible Braille and audio
        resources, they train teachers in tactile learning methods and develop assistive technologies—such as tactile
        diagrams and audio-based STEM kits—so that visually impaired students can fully engage with science and
        mathematics curricula. Vision Empower’s innovative programs have been recognized by national education bodies and
        deployed in over 50 schools across South India. 
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">
        <strong>Project: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/scalable-early-education-with-digital-scaffolding-seeds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiksha SEEDS</a></strong><br>
        Good quality access to early education and introduction to digital technologies empowers visually impaired
        children and prepares them for better opportunities for learning, education, and good careers. Many of these
        children go to special schools for Children with Disabilities (CwDs) where many of the teachers are also people
        with disabilities with limited technology awareness and access. Operating in 15 Indian states, Vision Empower
        Trust supports over 3,000 visually impaired students and 1,555 teachers across 134 schools. The Shiksha SEEDS
        initiative will leverage this existing infrastructure to enhance educational access and learning outcomes for
        visually impaired learners, by making key Gen AI enhancements to Subodha (existing accessible LMS at VE), such as
        voice-enabled content search in various local languages, building video content repository and accessible UX,
        and overall ensuring inclusive participation for these teachers and children in the digital education ecosystem.
