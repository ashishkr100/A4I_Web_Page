      For 2025‚Äì2026, A4I is partnering with three leading organizations in education and healthcare to scale impactful
      solutions across underserved communities. Below is an overview of our collaborative framework, followed by
      detailed sections on each partner and their flagship project.

      Three flagship projects have been prioritized for immediate scaling through the A4I collaborative framework: Shiksha Copilot, its extension Shiksha SEEDS, and ASHA Saheli for last-mile healthcare delivery. These initiatives are strategically aligned with the Government of India‚Äôs AI mandate and the IndiaAI Mission, positioning them as strong candidates to evolve into Digital Public Goods (DPGs) for adoption by central and state governments.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
      Each solution is designed to scale through trusted human intermediaries, such as teachers and health workers, who act as amplifiers of generative AI tools, extending their benefits far beyond direct users. For instance, 10,000 teachers using Shiksha Copilot could positively affect nearly one million students. With support from A4I and the open sourcing of these solutions, their reach is expected to expand from their current bases in Karnataka, Telangana, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan to other Indian states and countries across the Global South and Africa.

    </h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
      <strong>About the Organization:</strong><br>
      Vision Empower Trust is a Karnataka-based non-profit incubated at IIIT Bangalore. Their mission is to empower
      children with visual impairment through inclusive STEM education. By designing accessible Braille and audio
      resources, they train teachers in tactile learning methods and develop assistive technologies‚Äîsuch as tactile
      diagrams and audio-based STEM kits‚Äîso that visually impaired students can fully engage with science and
      mathematics curricula. Vision Empower‚Äôs innovative programs have been recognized by national education bodies and
      deployed in over 50 schools across South India.

      <strong>Project: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/scalable-early-education-with-digital-scaffolding-seeds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiksha SEEDS</a></strong><br>
      Good quality access to early education and introduction to digital technologies empowers visually impaired
      children and prepares them for better opportunities for learning, education, and good careers. Many of these
      children go to special schools for Children with Disabilities (CwDs) where many of the teachers are also people
      with disabilities with limited technology awareness and access. Operating in 15 Indian states, Vision Empower
      Trust supports over 3,000 visually impaired students and 1,555 teachers across 134 schools. The Shiksha SEEDS
      initiative will leverage this existing infrastructure to enhance educational access and learning outcomes for
      visually impaired learners, by making key Gen AI enhancements to Subodha (existing accessible LMS at VE), such as
      voice-enabled content search in various local languages, building video content repository and accessible UX,
      and overall ensuring inclusive participation for these teachers and children in the digital education ecosystem.
