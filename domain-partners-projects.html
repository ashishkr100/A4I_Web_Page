    <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
      For 2025‚Äì2026, A4I is partnering with three leading organizations in education and healthcare to <b>co-design and help in scaling</b> impactful
      solutions across underserved communities. Below is an overview of our collaborative framework. 
      Our three partners are <a href="https://www.khushibaby.org/">Khushi Baby Association</a> , 
      <a href="https://sikshana.org/">Sikshana Foundation</a> and 
      <a href="https://sikshana.org/">Vision Empower Trust</a>.

    <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
      Three flagship projects have been prioritized for immediate scaling through the A4I collaborative framework: 
      <b>Shiksha Copilot</b> - an AI enabled Teaching Assistant, <b>Shiksha SEEDS</b> - for accessible education of the visually impaired, 
      and <b>ASHABot</b> to facilitate last-mile healthcare delivery. 
      These initiatives are strategically aligned with the Government of India‚Äôs AI mandate and the <b>IndiaAI Mission</b>, 
      positioning them as strong candidates to evolve into Digital Public Goods (DPGs) for adoption by central and state governments.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
      Each solution is designed to scale through trusted human intermediaries, such as teachers and health workers, 
      who act as amplifiers of generative AI tools, extending their benefits far beyond direct users. 
      For instance, 10,000 teachers using Shiksha Copilot could positively affect nearly one million students. 
      With support from A4I and the open sourcing of these solutions, their reach is expected to expand from their current bases 
      in Karnataka, Telangana, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan to other Indian states and countries across the Global South and Africa.

    </h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
      <strong>About the Organization:</strong><br>
      Khushi Baby is a non-profit health technology organization focused on strengthening rural healthcare delivery in India. 
      By combining digital innovation with community engagement, Khushi Baby has supported over 11 million beneficiaries 
      and empowered 70,000+ frontline health workers across multiple states. 
      Their solutions improve maternal, child, and primary health by enabling real-time monitoring, digital training, 
      and informed decision-making at scale.

      <strong>Project: <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.10913v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASHAbot</a></strong><br>
      Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) are the backbone of community health in India. 
      However, their ability to deliver quality care is often constrained by 
      limited knowledge and lack of access to upskilling opportunities. To bridge this gap, 
      Khushi Baby partnered with Microsoft to develop ASHABot‚Äîan AI-powered chat solution on 
      WhatsApp that provides instant, reliable answers to ASHAs‚Äô health-related queries. 
      The system leverages a curated knowledge base comprising India‚Äôs public health manuals, immunization guidelines, 
      and family planning protocols. Unresolved queries are routed to a panel of ASHA supervisors, ensuring expert support. 
      The solution is currently deployed with 2,800 ASHAs across two districts in Rajasthan. Under A4I, it will be 
      scaled to 11,000 ASHA workers in the first year, and a scalable model for nationwide adoption will be created.

      Shiksha Copilot is an AI-powered teaching assistant that provides real-time lesson planning, automated remedial
      content, and individualized feedback to teachers. Integrated into the existing classroom ecosystem, it uses
      natural language processing to analyze student responses and suggest differentiated activities. This tool empowers
      educators to address learning gaps proactively and foster a supportive learning environment in resource-
      constrained settings.

    <p style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
      <strong>About the Organization:</strong><br>
      Vision Empower Trust is a Karnataka-based non-profit incubated at IIIT Bangalore. Their mission is to empower
      children with visual impairment through inclusive STEM education. By designing accessible Braille and audio
      resources, they train teachers in tactile learning methods and develop assistive technologies‚Äîsuch as tactile
      diagrams and audio-based STEM kits‚Äîso that visually impaired students can fully engage with science and
      mathematics curricula. Vision Empower‚Äôs innovative programs have been recognized by national education bodies and
      deployed in over 50 schools across South India.

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <strong>Project: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/scalable-early-education-with-digital-scaffolding-seeds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiksha SEEDS</a></strong><br>
      Access to quality early education and digital tools empowers visually impaired children for brighter learning and career opportunities. 
      Many of these children study in special schools where teachers‚Äîoften with disabilities themselves, and have limited exposure to 
      technology. Vision Empower Trust, working across 15 Indian states, already supports over 3,000 visually impaired students and 
      1,555 teachers in 134 schools. Building on this foundation, Shiksha SEEDS introduces a voice-based educational platform tailored 
      for visually impaired students and teachers, <b>delivering rich educational experiences at scale</b>. Complemented by initiatives such as 
      GenAI-powered enhancements to the accessible LMS (Subodha), voice-enabled content search in local languages, 
      and a video repository, SEEDS aims to drive greater inclusion in digital education.
