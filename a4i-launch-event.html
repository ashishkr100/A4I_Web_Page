        Joining virtually as Chief Guest, Uma spoke about AI’s growing potential in driving development and sustainability within education and healthcare. She urged stakeholders to be ambitious, rather than aiming only for “last-mile” reach, and underscored that AI can empower even illiterate and semi-literate populations to contribute locally. “We shouldn’t aim to reach people at the ‘last mile,’ but rather, right from the start, we should be even more ambitious in demanding solutions from technology. AI has the potential to solve problems in human development. With it, we can allow even the illiterate and semi-literate population to contribute at the local level.”
